This code is an advanced calculator program with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library for the interface, sympy for mathematical computations, and requests for downloading data. Below is a breakdown of the various parts of the code:

1. Creating the Calculator Class
The Calculator class is responsible for all the functions and the graphical user interface of the program. In this class, all the elements of the interface, events, and mathematical operations are handled.

2. Graphical User Interface
The program creates a main window using tkinter:

Tabs (Notebook): There are two main tabs in the program:
Basic Calculator: Contains basic numerical and operational buttons.
Scientific Calculator: Includes advanced scientific buttons like log2, pow, etc.


3. Equation Display
A display (using the Text widget) is provided for showing and entering equations or calculated values in the calculator. The display size is set with a large font to enhance user convenience. 


4. Button Frame
The buttons are created using a Frame and a Canvas that allows scrolling. With the vertical scroll bar and mouse wheel scrolling feature, a large number of buttons are included in the calculator.


5. Buttons and Functions
Buttons are divided into two sections: Basic Calculator and Scientific Calculator:

Basic Calculator: Contains primary buttons like +, -, *, /, C (clear), = (evaluate), and scientific functions like sin, cos, tan, etc.
Scientific Calculator: Contains advanced scientific operations such as log2, pow, mod, and some custom buttons.


6. Main Operations
Button Press: When a button is pressed, the corresponding value is added to the display, or a specific operation is performed. These operations include:
Evaluate (=): The equation entered in the display is evaluated using sympify (from the sympy library).
Solve Equation (حل معادله): If an equation with variables x, y, z is entered, this function solves it and displays the results.
Matrix Calculations: Allows users to enter matrices and solve matrix equations.
Download Data: Uses an HTTP request to fetch exchange rate data and display it.


7. Special Features
Solve Matrix Equation: This feature is designed to solve matrix equations. The user inputs matrices, and the program solves the equation using matrix inversion (inv).
Download Data: Retrieves currency exchange rates from an external API and displays them to the user.
Enter Matrix: Users can specify the number of rows and columns for a matrix and then input the matrix values into the entry fields.


8. Various Events
The program responds to several events:

Button Press: Each button has a specific function, which is called through the button_click method.
Mouse Scroll: The mouse wheel is supported for scrolling through the buttons.


9. Mathematical Functions (evaluate, solve, differentiate, integrate)
The program supports several mathematical operations:

evaluate_expression: Evaluates the entered mathematical equation and displays the result.
solve_equation: Solves an algebraic equation and shows the values of the variables.
solve_matrix_equation: Solves matrix equations using matrix inversion.


10. Functions in Development
Functions such as plot_graph (graph plotting), differentiate_expression (differentiation), and integrate_expression (integration) have not yet been fully implemented and need further development.

This code is a complete and advanced example of a calculator that provides not only basic functionality but also scientific and matrix capabilities.
